# 🔍 Regex Matcher Web Application (Flask)

A clean, interactive web application built using **Flask** that replicates the **core functionality of regex101.com** — allowing users to test regular expressions against custom input strings and instantly view all matched results.

## 🌟 Why This Project?

While learning **Flask and backend development**, I wanted to build something that:
- Solves a **real developer problem**
- Uses **regex practically**, not theoretically
- Demonstrates **client–server interaction**
- Combines **backend logic with a beautiful frontend**

This project was assigned as a hands-on task during my learning journey at **Innomatics Research Labs**, and it helped me bridge the gap between *learning Flask* and *building real-world web applications*.
